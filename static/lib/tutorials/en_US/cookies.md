# Cookies

_This tutorial is compatible with hapi v17 and newer_


## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

When writing a web application, cookies are often used to keep state about a user between requests. With hapi, cookies are flexible, secure, and simple to use.  

## <a name="server"></a> Configuring the server

hapi has several configurable options when dealing with cookies. The defaults are probably good for most cases, but can be changed when needed. To prepare a cookie, you first need to name it and configure a list of options. You do this by calling `server.state(name, [options])`.

### <a name="server.state"></a> server.state()

To use a cookie, you first need to configure it by calling [`server.state(name, [options])`](/api#server.state()) where `name` is the name of the cookie, and `options` is an object used to configure the cookie.

Please note that the default settings for `options` is good for most cases and don't need to be configured. For learning purposes, you will configure them in this tutorial:

```javascript
server.state('data', {
    ttl: null,
    isSecure: true,
    isHttpOnly: true,
    encoding: 'base64json',
    clearInvalid: true,
    strictHeader: true
});
```
In the example above, you first name the cookie `data`. You then configure the options to customize the cookie.

The first option is `ttl`. This represents the cookies time to live in milliseconds. The default setting is `null`, which will delete the cookie once the browser is closed.

Next we have two flags, `isSecure` and `isHttpOnly`. For more info on these flags, see ([RFC 6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265), specifically sections [4.1.2.5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.2.5) and [4.1.2.6](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.2.6).

You then tell hapi that the value is a base64 encoded JSON string.

By setting `clearInvalid` to `true`, it instructs the client to remove invalid cookies.

Last, you set `strictHeader` to `true` so that there are no violations of [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265).

### <a name="options.state"></a> route.options.state()

In addition to this, you can further configure cookie behavior at a route-level by specifying two properties at the route's `options.state` object.

Please note that configurations to cookies on the route-level are in addition to those configurations made by `server.state`.

```json5
{
    options: {
        state: {
            parse: true,
            failAction: 'error'
        }
    }
}
```
The `parse` option determines if cookies are parsed and stored in `request.state`.

The `failAction` options determines how cookie parsing errors will be handled.

## <a name="setting"></a> Setting a cookie

Setting a cookie is done via the [response toolkit](/api#response-toolkit) in a request handler, pre-requisite, or request lifecycle extension point.

### <a name="h.state"></a> h.state()

You set a cookie by calling [`h.state(name, value, [options]`](/api#h.state()). In the following example, you set a cookie in a route handler:

```javascript
server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/',
    handler: function (request, h) {

        h.state('data', { firstVisit: false });
        return h.response('Hello');
    }
});
```
In this example, you use the cookie we configured in the section above. Here, hapi will reply with the string `Hello` as well as set a cookie named `data` to a base64 encoded JSON string representation of `{ firstVisit: false }`.

The `state()` method is also available on the [response object](/api#response-object) which allows for convenient chaining. The above example can therefore also be written:

```javascript
return h.response('Hello').state('data', { firstVisit: false });
```

## <a name="override"></a> Overriding options

When setting a cookie, you may also pass the same options available to `server.state()` as a third parameter, such as:

```javascript
return h.response('Hello').state('data', 'test', { encoding: 'none' });
```

In this example the cookie will simply be set to the string `"test"` with no encoding.

## <a name="value"></a> Getting a cookie value

Access a cookieâ€™s value via `request.state` in a route handler, pre-requisite, or request lifecycle extension point.

The `request.state` object contains the parsed HTTP state. Each key represents the cookie name and its value is the defined content.  If multiple cookies with the same name are present on the request, the values are exposed as an array rather than a single value.

The sample code uses the `data` cookie key from above where the related value is set to `{ firstVisit: false }`:

```javascript
const value = request.state.data;
// console.log(value) will give you { firstVisit : false }
```

## <a name="clear"></a> Clearing a cookie

The cookie can be cleared by calling the `unstate()` method on the [response toolkit](/api#response-toolkit) or [response object](/api#response-object):

```javascript
return h.response('Bye').unstate('data');
```
Here, you just pass the name of the cookie into `unstate()` to clear the cookie.
