# Server Methods

_This tutorial is compatible with hapi v17 and newer_


## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

Server methods are a useful way of sharing functions by attaching them to your server object rather than requiring a common module everywhere it is needed. Server methods are also used heavily for caching purposes. Since server methods leverage hapi's native caching, they can help reduce your boilerplate to a minimum. See the caching tutorial for more. To register a server method, you call [`server.method()`](/api#server.method()). There are two different ways to call this function. You can call it with the signature `server.method(name, method, [options])`, or you can call it with the signature `server.method(method)`, where `method` is an object with `name`, `method`, and `options` parameters (note that you may also pass an array of these objects).

## <a name="server.method"></a> server.method()

The first way to call `server.method()` is with the signature `server.method(name, method, [options])`:

```js
const add = function (x, y) {

    return x + y;
};

server.method('add', add, {});
```
Here, you create a function called `add`, which takes two parameters and adds them together. Then you call `server.method()` with the name of the method being `add`, the method you are using, the one we just created called `add`, and no options.  

The second way to call `server.method()` is with the signature `server.method(method)`:

```js
const add = function (x, y) {

    return x + y;
};

server.method({
    name: 'add',
    method: add,
    options: {}
});
```
You create the same function again, called `add`. When you register it this time, configure the `method` object. This case, `name` is the name of the method, `method` is the method you are using, and `options` is an object to configure various options.

### <a name="name"></a> Name

The `name` parameter is a string used to retrieve the method from the server later, via [`server.methods[name]`](#server.methods). Note that if you specify a `name` with a `.` character, it is registered as a nested object rather than the literal string. As in:

```javascript
server.method('math.add', add);
```

This server method can then be called via `server.methods.math.add()`.

### <a name="method"></a> Method

The `method` parameter is the actual function to call when the method is invoked. It can take any number of arguments. It can be an `async` function, for example:

```js
const add = async function (x, y) {

    const result = await someLongRunningFunction(x, y);
    return result;
};

server.method('add', add, {});
```

Your server method function should return a valid result or throw an error if one occurs.

## <a name="options"></a> Options

When registering `server.method()`, you can configure three `options`: `cache`, `generateKey`, and `bind`.

### <a name="cache"></a> Cache

A major advantage of server methods is that they may leverage hapi's native caching. The default is to not cache, however if a valid configuration is passed when registering the method, the return value will be cached and served from the cache instead of re-running your method every time it is called. The configuration looks like the following:

```javascript
server.method('add', add, {
    cache: {
        expiresIn: 60000,
        expiresAt: '20:30',
        staleIn: 30000,
        staleTimeout: 10000,
        generateTimeout: 100
    }
});
```

The parameters mean:

* `expiresIn`: relative expiration expressed in the number of milliseconds since the item was saved in the cache. Cannot be used together with `expiresAt`.
* `expiresAt`: time of day expressed in 24h notation using the 'HH:MM' format, at which point all cache records for the route expire. Uses local time. Cannot be used together with `expiresIn`.
* `staleIn`: number of milliseconds to mark an item stored in cache as stale and attempt to regenerate it. Must be less than `expiresIn`.
* `staleTimeout`: number of milliseconds to wait before returning a stale value while generateFunc is generating a fresh value.
* `generateTimeout`: number of milliseconds to wait before returning a timeout error when it takes too long to return a value. When the value is eventually returned, it is stored in the cache for future requests.
* `segment`: an optional segment name used to isolate cache items.
* `cache`: an optional string with the name of the cache connection configured on your server to use

More information on the caching options can be found in the [API Reference](/api#server.methods) as well as the documentation for [catbox](/module/catbox#policy).

You can override the `ttl` (time-to-live) of a server method result per-invocation by setting the `ttl` flag. Let's see how this works with the earlier example:

```js
const add = async function (x, y, flags) {

    const result = await someLongRunningFunction(x, y);

    flags.ttl = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 mins

    return result;
};

server.method('add', add, {
    cache: {
        expiresIn: 2000,
        generateTimeout: 100
    }
});
```

Here you defined your server method function to have one more parameter than you're expecting to pass to it, the additional `flags` parameter is passed by hapi. You then simply set the `ttl` flag to however long you want the result to be cached for (in milliseconds); if it is set to `0` then the value will never be cached. If you set no flag then the `ttl` will be taken from the cache configuration.

### <a name="key"></a> Generate a Custom Key

In addition to the above options, you may also define a custom function used to generate a cache key based on the parameters passed to your method. If your method only accepts some combination of string, number, and boolean values hapi will generate a sane key for you. However, if your method accepts an object parameter, you should specify a function that will generate a cache key similar to the following:

```javascript
const sum = function (array) {

    let total = 0;

    array.forEach((item) => {

        total += item;
    });

    return total;
};

server.method('sum', sum, {
    generateKey: (array) => array.join(',')
});
```

Any arguments that you pass to your method are available to the `generateKey` method.

### <a name="bind"></a> Bind

The last option available to server methods is `bind`. The `bind` option changes the `this` context within the method. It defaults to the current active context when the method is added. This can be useful for passing in a database client without needing to pass it as a parameter and requiring a custom `generateKey` function, as in:

```javascript
const lookup = async function (id) {

    // calls myDB.getOne

    return await this.getOne({ id });
};

server.method('lookup', lookup, { bind: myDB });
```

## <a name="server.methods"></a> server.methods

To call the server methods we registered above, you would use `server.methods()`. Consider our add function:

```js
const add = function (x, y) {

    return x + y;
};

server.method({
    name: 'add',
    method: add,
    options: {}
});
```

To use this method, simply call `server.methods()`

```js
server.methods.add(1, 2);  // 3
```
